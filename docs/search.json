    "text": "My work involves creating reproducible reports using our medical registry data. Typically, we create two types of reports: ‘registry reports,’ which utilize descriptive statistics from the entire registry, and ‘clinic reports,’ which compare data from one clinic to the aggregated data of all other clinics. Until now, we have been utilizing the statistical software package ‘STATA.’ While STATA allows for reproducible reporting, the project setup process is laborious, and it lacks flexibility in choosing the output format.\nRStudio, an open-source statistical package widely used in biomedical research, offers an alternative. Its package called ‘QUARTO’ promises to provide a simpler way of creating reproducible reports with multiple options for output formats.\n\n\nAim of this project is to assess the potential of Rstudio’s ‘QUARTO’-package for reproducible reporting of registry data.\n\n\n\nDummy data was obtained using the ‘Framingam’ data set (‘riskCommunicator’-package). Dummy department_IDs were created. Please refer to the QUARTO-file for the code."

Since this is not very interesting, the following is done instead: Quartiles of BMI are created. Thereafter the hypothesis will be tested that systolic blood pressure (sysbp) is different in the highest vs. lowest quartile of BMI. This will be done for the entire registry (chaptr. 3.2) and for “my clinic” only (chaptr. 3.3).\n\n\n3.2.1 box-plot of systolic bp\nA box-plot of sysbp for quartiles 1 and 4 of BMI is shown below.\n\n\n\nAttache Paket: 'rstatix'\n\n\nDas folgende Objekt ist maskiert 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph indeed indicates that there may be a significant (and potentially relevant) difference between the two groups. Let’s do a t-test.\n\n\n3.2.2 t-test (entire registry data)\nSince the number of observations is relatively high in both groups, a t-test can be performed (central limit theorem).\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 8\n  .y.   group1 group2    n1    n2 statistic    df        p\n* <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <int> <int>     <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 sysbp 1      4       1104  1103     -18.5 2130. 1.17e-70\n\n\nIndeed, the p-value of 1.17e-70 indicates extremely strong evidence against the null hypothesis of equal means across groups. Therefore, the observed difference is highly significant."

It is anticipated that due to the lower number of observations and therefore increased likeliness of non-normal data distribution, non-parametric tests will have to be applied.\n\n3.3.1 Histogram and qqplot within “my clinic”\nIn the following, the histograms and qqplots for both groups, first and fourth quartile of BMI, are shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphs indicate that the data is not uniformly distributed, particularly for the 4th BMI quartile, where the distribution of sysbp appears to be right-skewed. To test this hypothesis, a Shapiro test is performed.\n\n\n3.3.2 Shapiro-test\n\n\n[1] \"Shapiro-Wilk test result for db_clin_1\"\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\n  variable           statistic p.value\n  <chr>                  <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 get(df_name)$sysbp     0.970   0.268\n[1] \"Shapiro-Wilk test result for db_clin_2\"\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\n  variable           statistic p.value\n  <chr>                  <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 get(df_name)$sysbp     0.927 0.00646\n\n\n\n\nNote: the Shapiro-test has been performed twice using a for-loop. In the output above “db_clin_1” refers to the first quartile of BMI, “db_clin_2” refers to the 4th quartile of BMI.\n\n\nFor the group with the highest BMI, we obtain a highly significant test-result. This means that the present distribution of data is very unlikely under the null hypothesis of normal distribution. Therefore, the non-parametric Wilcoxon-test is performed.\n\n\n3.3.3 Wilcoxon-Test\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 7\n  .y.   group1 group2    n1    n2 statistic         p\n* <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <int> <int>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 sysbp 1      4         47    46       508 0.0000108\n\n\nAlso in this reduced data-set of “my clinic”, using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-test, a highly significant p-value suggests a highly significant difference between the two groups."
